LOIC for Android
================

This is my Version of the LOIC-App from [MohammadAdib](http://github.com/MohammadAdib/).

I don't want to make profit with this or steal it in any way, I just think is version could be made better. And I was too lazy to make a pull request.


##What I changed

First of all, I have no idea how Java works and I propably never will get this. In my opinion it is just way too complicated. I like my C stuff. Or bash...

Anyway, I know how to use XML, GIMP and I even understand *some* of the Java code in here, so I changed quite a bit.

- ADDED: A funny warning at the first start.
- ADDED: Strings.
- CHANGED: Some of the texts.
- CHANGED: The Icon to a better one.
- CHANGED: The whole UI.
- CHANGED: Colors.
- REMOVED: Hardcoded Text.
- REMOVED: Stupid imags, stealing space.
- REMOVED: A lot of spacetaking parts of the UI.

And a lot more I think...

##A word of caution

Using this application against the law may lead to consequences. Use LOIC Responsibly.I take definetly no responsibility for your actions.

##Licensing

As mentioned before, I kind of stole this. But to make it even better, I WON'T use the Apache License. (I think this is my only license violation though.) I'm using my own KOSSL, which is in the LICENSE file, because I think it's better.

##Last Words

This is more like a private Repo, I think my version is better, but I really recommend using the original Version. I hope the original developer doesn't get angry about this, but if he wants it, I will remove it. (I am not a thief after all. Pirate yes. But I usually respect licenses.)
